business_overview:
  description: |
    The Presentation rules editor allows users to select an iModel that they have access to, and run provided Presentation rules against it, quickly seeing the results in primary components: tree, table, property grid.
technical_overview:
  description: |
    The Presentation rules editor is a React static site. It uses iTwins and iModels APIs to query datasets available for the user, including the demo ones that are available for all users. The iModels visualization service is used to evaluate provided Presentation rules against the selected iModel.

      The static assets of the Presentation rules editor are critical to the application's functionality. The application cannot run without these assets. Users cannot access the the application without fetching these assets.
      The static assets are marked public, in that every user gets the same static pages. The assets make up a single page application, indirectly served from an Azure Storage Account and proxied through Azure Front Door.

      React mitigates cross site scripting by design, to a certain level - React escapes strings inserted into HTML by default. In addition, functional React components enables us to manipulate the DOM through React state management, and validate those states.
      We do not use "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" in our codebase either.

      Users access the static site by making requests to the CDN edge servers closest to them, not by directly accessing the Storage Account and retrieving the static assets. The static assets are cached in the CDN edge servers, and served from there. The static site is served over HTTPS, and the Azure CDN edge servers are protected by Azure Front Door, delegating the hardening to these Azure resources.
      While the contents of the static site change depending on the URL query parameters passed in, those contents are also gated by user authorization and authentication, preventing escalation of privilege.
